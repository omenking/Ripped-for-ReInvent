## Overcoming DOMs

I want to at least workout 4 times a week eg. Mon,Tue,Thu,Fri

But I find DOMs preventing me due to the amount of soreness.

So I'm looking for ways to reduce DOMs.

Research suggests that I just need to workout through DOMs
and that it should get less worst as I get more fit.

## Improve Macros

Through reddit I found the Fitness Wiki

In the muscle building guide they are suggestion a 0.8g per lb or 160 lb of protien (which ever is greater)

### TDDE Calculation

Using this free TDDE calculator for:
https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=imperial&g=male&age=35&lbs=170&in=73&act=1.375&bf=22&f=1

My Inputs:

- 35
- Male
- 170 weight
- 6'1 ft
- Light Exercise 
- 22 % body


I get a rough estimate of macros:

| type | protien | fats | carbs |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| moderate carb | 172g | 89g | 201g
| low carb  | 230g | 102g | 115g
| higher carb  | 172g | 51g | 287g

> I actually weight 168 but I can't tell because my floor in uneven so I over estimated.

2295 calories per day

IF we divide this into 3 meals:

| calories | protien | fats | carbs |
| 765 | 57.3 | 29.6 | 67 |




## Challenges

### Protien Goal
Right now I think I will have hard time hitting 160g protien
since I'm only around 60g a day right now.

So I'll have to work to adjusting my macro intake.

### Body Fat is Not Accurate

I don't an accurate weight to measure except search "body fat percentages examples"
and taking my best guess. I could be lower or higher.

I order off of Amazon [Body Fat Caliper and Measuring Tape for Body](https://www.amazon.ca/Body-Fat-Caliper-Measuring-Tape/dp/B07NYHQYN4/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=3NK4WV0NL5PS5&keywords=calipers+for+measuring+body+fat&qid=1670682814&sprefix=calipers%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-3-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE0RzJCMjFKVVdaWEUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0NDA5MjBJSzNMNkUxWUU1R08mZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NzMyNDJGRTY5NTBIUkExVDMmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl). 

I do know my clinical dietican told me not to bother with calipers 
because to use them correctly by yourself is difficult but I am disregarding
this advice.

### Turkish Get Up

I'm using Mark Wildemans workoute routine and it has 4 moves I need to be good at:
- Swings
- Squats
- TGU
- Clean and Press

I forget how to do TGU and I really need to get these down.


I created (WIP) workout schedule

I'm using this playlist here

## Homework

- calculate macros breakdown for foods I already eat
- determine a simple (borining food plan) to hit target macros and calorie intake
- get better at TGU
- try and increase Protien for today
- workout through doms
