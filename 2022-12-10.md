## New Knowledge

### Shared Resource

https://kettlebellsworkouts.com/

A friend shared this. Never bought it, but affordable.
I dunno. I think I just want to stick to learning th 5 motions Mark Wildman wants me to learn.

### Overcoming DOMs

I want to at least workout 4 times a week eg. Mon,Tue,Thu,Fri

But I find DOMs preventing me due to the amount of soreness.

So I'm looking for ways to reduce DOMs.

Research suggests that I just need to workout through DOMs
and that it should get less worst as I get more fit.

### Improve Macros

Through reddit I found the Fitness Wiki

In the muscle building guide they are suggestion a 0.8g per lb or 160 lb of protien (which ever is greater)

### TDDE Calculation

Using this free TDDE calculator for:
https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=imperial&g=male&age=35&lbs=170&in=73&act=1.375&bf=22&f=1

My Inputs:

- 35
- Male
- 170 weight
- 6'1 ft
- Light Exercise 
- 22 % body


I get a rough estimate of macros:

| type | protien | fats | carbs |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| moderate carb | 172g | 89g | 201g
| low carb  | 230g | 102g | 115g
| higher carb  | 172g | 51g | 287g

> I actually weight 168 but I can't tell because my floor in uneven so I over estimated.

2295 calories per day

IF we divide this into 3 meals:

| calories | protien | fats | carbs |
| 765 | 57.3 | 29.6 | 67 |




## Todays Workout

### Turkish Getup

I attempted Turkish getup on my left and right with a 10lb Kettlbell.
I am straining my shoulder when attemping to do the leg sweep


I was suing Mark's but not sure I have the legsweep getup part down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YollP91Wro

This one shows more steps with the getup with leg sweep but I don't know how to get sqaure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bWRPC49-KI&t=39s

I tried then practing with no-weight but I could not still get it right.
And felt discomfort im my shoulder.

I may really need to find someone who knows how to do this excerise because
I cannot see what I'm doing, while watching videos.


## Swings


I reviewed Mark's two handed kettle bell swing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-S9H2XVvYg&t=89s


I used a 20 lb kettlebell

I used this tool to create a 10 1 minute rounds with 30 seconds break.
https://www.intervaltimer.com/create/round-timer

As I got past the third round I needed more rest time.

I could only make it to 6 rounds, until my form was too poor to continue.
s
Next week I'll have to up it to 7 rounds.

## Halos and Goblin Squat

This probably should been my warmup but I decided to do
3 rounds at 60 seconds. So I halo one direction, squat, and then halo other direction and squat.

## Challenges

### Protien Goal
Right now I think I will have hard time hitting 160g protien
since I'm only around 60g a day right now.

So I'll have to work to adjusting my macro intake.

### Body Fat is Not Accurate

I don't an accurate weight to measure except search "body fat percentages examples"
and taking my best guess. I could be lower or higher.

I order off of Amazon [Body Fat Caliper and Measuring Tape for Body](https://www.amazon.ca/Body-Fat-Caliper-Measuring-Tape/dp/B07NYHQYN4/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=3NK4WV0NL5PS5&keywords=calipers+for+measuring+body+fat&qid=1670682814&sprefix=calipers%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-3-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE0RzJCMjFKVVdaWEUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0NDA5MjBJSzNMNkUxWUU1R08mZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NzMyNDJGRTY5NTBIUkExVDMmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl). 

I do know my clinical dietican told me not to bother with calipers 
because to use them correctly by yourself is difficult but I am disregarding
this advice.

### Turkish Get Up

I'm using Mark Wildemans workoute routine and it has 4 moves I need to be good at:
- Swings
- Squats
- TGU
- Clean and Press

I forget how to do TGU and I really need to get these down.


I created (WIP) workout schedule
https://lucid.app/lucidchart/a4ed9a1f-660e-4fae-869d-956a45f6edf2/edit?viewport_loc=-403%2C-734%2C3768%2C2010%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_8685c916-5240-4016-99f6-f475ce29004f

I'm using this playlist here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAcBo4H__hE&list=PLk4oYPJ7TXKghMc2nlimqsociFyMi9_xx

## Homework

- calculate macros breakdown for foods I already eat
- determine a simple (borining food plan) to hit target macros and calorie intake
- get better at TGU
- try and increase Protien for today
- workout through doms
