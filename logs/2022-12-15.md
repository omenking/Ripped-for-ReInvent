Recovery day.

My triceps are quite sore still.

I was going to attempt pushups but I don't want to engage my triceps.

I should be doing somekind of calories burning excises buy I don't have a routine yet.

I'll have to do some research

## Workout

I didn't want to just sit a home all day.
So I went to the gym at night and I did 30mins walk at 3.7 mph with a 4 incline.

Than I did some kettlbell swings:
1x10 - 8kg
1x12 - 12kg
1x12 - 20kg


## Smith Machine (Chest Workout)

My gym has this Smith Machine.
And I can see that it can do crossover cables

So now I'm seeing if its worth it to do this execise for chest
since it seems like I don't like doing barbell presses.
