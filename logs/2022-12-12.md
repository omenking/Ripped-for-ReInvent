Today is a recovery day, though I don't feel I need much recovery.

## New Knowledge

### S&S Deficits
I read about Simple & Sinister and how it is an accompanying program to primary training.
So its an incomplete program since its just swings and TGUs five days a week.
Good for conditioning, but can't expect body recomp.

### Hyperthrophy with Kettleblee

I've been reading about Hypertrophy for Kettlebell.
Maybe I can fill in my gaps with this:

The staple of bodybuilding exercises are the following excerises:

- front squats
- shoulder presses
- chest presses
- rows
- carries
- isometrics
- curls

hypertrophy is:
- grind excercises
- Time under Tension (TuT)

## One Rep Max

A 1-rep max refers to the maximum amount of weight you can lift for one repetition of a given exercise.
So when people say we'll do 80% to failure they are talking about the One Rep Max. or 1 rm

##  Mike Mahler Routine

I found on BodyBuilding.com mention of Mike's routine:
https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=174795611&highlight=kettlebell


It uses a 5x5 system, and has more workouts that look like they target hyperthropy 
3 mins between sets.
- the negative and positive needs to be slower to increase time under tension
  - negative (4 seconds)
  - positive (2 seconds)
- Since we can't increase weight we can increase the negative and positives to increase difficult
- Another we can do is reduce time between sets 3 mins, 2 mins, 90 seconds, 60 seconds

## SuperSets

The concept of a superset is to perform 2 exercises back to back, followed by a short rest (but not always). This effectively doubles the amount of work you are doing, whilst keeping the recovery periods the same as they are when you complete individual exercises
