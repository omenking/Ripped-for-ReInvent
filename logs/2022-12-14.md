## Workout


### Warmup

- Halos
- Globin Prying Squats
- Strong-first Hip Bridge

### Primary Routing

5x20 double kettlebell swing

Honestly I prefer doing 20 at a time.
It might indicate I need a heavier weight but this is as heavy as I can go
with what I have, unless maybe the gym has a heavier single arm one.

Technically my 25lb single arm would be heavier but I haven't done any single arms yet.
