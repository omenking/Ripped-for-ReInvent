## New Knwowledge

My heavy club arrived.
Its 10lbs but I can do a basic halo its heavy...
or my triceps need to recovery since they are hella sore.

## Workout


### Warmup

- Halos
- Globin Prying Squats
- Strong-first Hip Bridge

### Primary Routing

#### Kettlebell Swing

5x20 double kettlebell swing

Honestly I prefer doing 20 at a time.
It might indicate I need a heavier weight but this is as heavy as I can go
with what I have, unless maybe the gym has a heavier single arm one.

Technically my 25lb single arm would be heavier but I haven't done any single arms yet.


#### Chest Exercises

Since I did so many single arm presses my triceps were quite sore so
I thought I'd figured out chest excersies

### Barbell Flys

I looked for a workout that I could use for chest that does not engage
triceps and I got the barbell fles.

I did 4 sets of 5.

### Bar Bench Press

I watched Meg Squats video.

I did 4 sets of 3.
I did not feel my chest muscles engage.
It could be because I'm not going through the full range of motion
which is to bring it down all thwe way to my chest,
or my chest muscles are very underdeveloped


### Incline Bench Press

I watched this video but didn't attempt an incline, why? I dunno

### Dips

There is a machine at the gym.
It couldn't do it and almost strained my shoulder

### Pushups

I watched this on pushups.
Maybe this is something I can do.

I know if I can't peform this at home I'll have to use the squat rack to use an olympic bar as an assist
