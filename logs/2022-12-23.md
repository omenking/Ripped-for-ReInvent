## New Knowledge

### Increase Protein

I was talking to Tyler over in Terrace Bay and he was suggesting a higher amount of protien
eg. 1.5g protein per lb and calories in the 3000s.

I did more research and it looks like maybe I should be at least having 1g of protein per lb
In terms of increasing calories I'm uncertain.

### Simple and Sinister

I've been reading through simple and sinster book and its been very helpful improving form.

Another important thing I found is using heavier weights help me know if my form is correct.

## Workout

### Warmup

I did the three warmups in the Simple and Sinsiter suggested:
- Goblin Prying Squats
- Halos
- Strong First Hip Bridge

### Swings

So today I did 10x10 swings with double kettlebell (20lbs)
I did this since I don't have a 35lb so I was attempting to increase my weight.

The Simple and Sinster instructions helps me improve form for being more explosive on the swing
and ensuring I am doing the hinge correctly.

#### TGUs

I took me 25lb weight and I went to the gym to see if they had a 35lb.
I strained myself attempting to do TGU with the lightest weight there (12kg)

I could not complete it with the 8kg (17kg)

I started with no weight and then I kept doign sets using dumbells:
- 10lb
- 12.5lb
- 15lb

There was no 20kg dumbbell, I looked fo a 17.5lb dumbbell but nothing there.

Now maybe I could do a 8kg but it was soft-style kettlebell, and I found these
very difficult to grip.

I do have 20lbs at home, maybe I'll just have to keep at it with 15lbs

#### Single Arm Press

Since I thought I gave up on TGU (I actually came back to it)

I didn't want to waste my gym time so I decided to decided to do presses.

I did 6 sets of 5 with 8kg soft style.
I did 1 set of 3 with the 25lb hard-style that I own.

I believe I can do 20lbs, but I didn't have them at the gym.


### Workout Chalk

I ordered workout chalk since it was recommended in Simple and Sinister


### Cooldown

Failed to do any cooldown since I was at the gym and I have yet to practice them.

## Diet

No gas anymore, it may have been the split peas, it may have been the soy.
I need to reintroce soymilk on Dec 15th to find out.

I came across protein wraps that have 10g.
So just something new I can eat.
