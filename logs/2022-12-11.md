### Mysterious Production of Gas

So something I'm eating is contributing to a gas.

- Soya Milk?
- Protein Powder?
- Increase in Protein

I am going to pause the Soya Milk for 4 days and see if its the culprit.
My Low Fodmap app says Soya Milk 1 cup unsweeted is safe but not sweeted

The only Soya Milk I can get is sweetend (Silk).
So maybe I need to pick up unsweeted next time I'm in town.


### Adding Heavy Mce

Last night I ordered a heavy mace because I want
to add that as my backburner activity through the week based on this Nerd Math video by Mark Widlman

## Workout

### Warmup

I did some neck excerises, I really need to get prepped a plan.

Mark Wildman talks about four areas:

I guess the question is, do I need to target certain warmsups for what I'm working out
or just doing all 4 categories covers everything...


### Primary Routine

I want to do a double clean and press, but I not confident with my form.
So I went to single clean and press, but then decided to do the cleans and presses seperate

I can do clean and press with 20lbs, but not that many....

#### Cleans

Single cleans, 6 sets (10 repss) 15lb weight

#### Presses

Single cleans, 5 sets (10 repss) 15lb weight

My left fatigued at 5 sets

### EZ Bar Bell

I feel like there are no workouts targeting my arms.
I think that is what Kettlebell snatch is for.

I have a EZ bar with 25 lbs both sizes and I did outside,medium and inside curls.
Great pump but strain in my shoulders and neck.

I think I'll stick with Kettlebells and start adding Snatches to practice with light weight
on my recovery days.

### Squats

4 sets x 10 reps with 15 lb

I was treating this like a "light day" even though I don't have proper program in place.
I just didn't want to be lifting heavy all day.
