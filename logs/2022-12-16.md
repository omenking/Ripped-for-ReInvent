I did my usual swings and attempted TGUs.
Unforently I found my left was too weak and so I have some serious imbalnce issues.

I decided to attempt to do some arm exercises with the kettlebell so I can learn how
I can adapt more home routines.

I found the Kettlebell hammers to be quite useful to do.
