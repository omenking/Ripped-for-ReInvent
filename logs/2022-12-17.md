I went to the gym and spent two hours there as I figured out how to make use of the Smith mi7 machine.

So I now can safely perform chest bench presses since the have safe gaurds.

I was not able to perform a decline chest press since the bench is not a decline bench
so I will need to attempt to modify it but I was low on time.

I did also focus on traps with shrugs and overhead trap raise.


I did three farmers walks to round up traps.

I don't know if Traps and Chest is a proper pairing but it was because I focused on learning.

I need to find out about new workout routines.
