## Interval Timer


I use this but there are some things I wish I could do:
https://www.intervaltimer.com/

- change the timer sound (the current one makes my dogs bark)
- put in text-to-speech to add coaching ques so I can remember how to keep proper form
- a clear input for "get ready", between the round and break
- a big button to extend the current break by 10 seconds
- a big button to extend current and future breaks by 10 seconds
- different music for each round/break/get-ready stage
